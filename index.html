        <p id="text">I chose GitHub as my website hosting provider for a few reasons, it's very easy and simple to use, their website is very clean and easy to understand, they also have good developer support tools like markdown, they also have a very efficient repository file conversion tool, the main reason I chose Github was that it offers unlimited public repositories for free and also Github has great interactions with other applications.</p>
